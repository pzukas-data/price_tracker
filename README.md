# Air Conditioner Price Tacker: Scraping Data Using Python
## About

The goal of this project was to create a tool that scrapes data from four Lithuanian websites selling a specific air conditioner model and and stores the data in a MySQL database. The script uses the requests library to retrieve the webpage HTML and the BeautifulSoup library to extract the relevant price information from each page. The mysql-connector library is used to establish a connection to the MySQL database and insert the data.

The websites being scraped are specdarbai.lt, komfortocentras.lt, kondicionieriai24.lt, and derekis.lt. 

This scraper can be useful to reuse for someone who needs to monitor the price of a product across multiple websites and wants to store the data in a MySQL database for further analysis or tracking

Completed during Data Analytics studies at Vilnius CODING School for Python course.
