# Air Conditioner Price Tacker: Scraping Data Using Python
## About

The goal of this project was to create a tool that scrapes data from four Lithuanian websites selling a specific air conditioner model and and stores the data in a MySQL database. The script uses the requests library to retrieve the webpage HTML and the BeautifulSoup library to extract the relevant price information from each page. The mysql-connector library is used to establish a connection to the MySQL database and insert the data.


The websites being scraped are specdarbai.lt, komfortocentras.lt, kondicionieriai24.lt, and derekis.lt.
